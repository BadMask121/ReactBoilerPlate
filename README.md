# ReactBoilerPlate
My production based react boilerplate ( NOT ANOTHER REACT BOILERPLATE ;(   )

This is not your ordinary react boilerplate.

This boilerplate takes into account of react redux and uses the Redux Docks design pattern
and also adopts the style of container and presentational way of creating react components

Make sure you:

# `npm i` to install

and

# `npm start` to start project
